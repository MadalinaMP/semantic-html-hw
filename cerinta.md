Update one of your previous homework to use semantic elements and CSS positioning techniques that you learned about.

-> Use in your code as many elements of the following: article, aside, section, header, footer, nav, main
-> Try to have at least one element that's positioned using float, relative, absolute and fixed position values. 
-> Use other CSS properties to style your content, keeping in mind to avoid repetition, and to keep them well organized.
